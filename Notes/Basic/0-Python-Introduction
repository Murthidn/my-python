Main Concepts in Python
    * Data Types
    * Type Conversion
    * Operators
    * Flow Control
    * Looping
    * Input/Output Functions
    * Function
        Lambdas/Decorators/Generators
    * Classes/Object
        Inheritance/Abstraction/Polymorphism/Encapsulation
        Python is Very Powerful as it's both Functional and Object(classes) oriented language
    * Exception Handling
    * Files
    * Regular Expressions
    * Multi Threading
        Key to develop enterprise applications
        3 Different ways to create MT in Python

What is Python?
    * It's an Interpreted (very quick, co compilation step), Function and Object Oriented Programming language
    * Easy to learn and simple syntax
    * We can develop software rapidly as it has inbuilt Libraries/Modules

Why Python?
    * Easy to Learn and Use
    * Performance - Super Speed as it has no compilation step
    * Rapid Development - Python has inbuilt modules/libraries, no need to code a lot, so quick development
    * Dynamically Typed - Decides Dynamically what type of data that variable has
    * Community - Python has huge community/support
    * Third Party Libraries - Python can be easily integrated with any Third Party Libraries ex: CherryPy, Boto
