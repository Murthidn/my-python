In Python Data Types are organized mainly in 5 Types
1) None Type - Doesn't contain any value ex: x = None
2) Numeric Types - int, float, complex, binary, hexa decimal, octal, boolean
    Here we just hold single value, but when in real time applications we need to hold multiple or sequence values @ a time, So Sequences!
3) Sequences - Sequence of other data types
    String, Bytes, Byte Array, List, Tuple, Range
    To hold multiple values on real time application which may come from Database, APIs or some sources!
    So we'll use "Inbuilt Collections or Data Structures - List, Set, Dictionary"

    * List
        Can store any number of values or objects dynamically
    * Set
        Can store any number of values but doesn't allows duplicates
    * Dictionary
        Is a Map, stores in Key & Value pair

4) Set - Doesn't allow duplicates
5) Mappings - Map & Reduce
