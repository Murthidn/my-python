Why to Learn Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.
Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation,
Since Python is interpreted language, the advantage is it runs in any system
dis advantage is: speed / time is more than compiled languages

why

Python.py -> Byte Code -> Interpreter -> Machine Lang

Actually python also has compiler,
src code will be instruction ex: Move a,b | add a, b...etc
so here line by line instruction will be executed! so interpreted!
then machine language

why we made so complex by having compilation and interpretatiion?
the one main reason that! we use concept called Byte code to achieve PORTABILITY!

Why Python is slow and others are fast?
